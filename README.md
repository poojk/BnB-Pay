## Introduction

When looking to buy a property in a city, rental income that can be obtained from an AirBnB hosting over the course of the mortgage is required so as to plan loans and expenses.

Data from spending and economic activity and AirBnB would provide hosts or prospective hosts with the ability to look at the sensitivity of pricing to macroeconomic conditions.

Places with a lot of international tourism might have price sensitivity related to German or Chinese measures of consumer activity and unemployment. But places with a lot of regional tourism might be totally insensitive to that and only depend on how well the fracking industry is doing. So if I am trying to decide between cities and I want a good estimate of what I can get out of AirBnB over the course of a thirty year mortgage this dasboard can help.
