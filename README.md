## Introduction

When looking to buy a property in a city, rental income that can be obtained from an AirBnB hosting over the course of the mortgage is required so as to plan loans and expenses.

Data from spending and economic activity and AirBnB would provide hosts or prospective hosts with the ability to look at the sensitivity of pricing to macroeconomic conditions.

If I was looking at moving somewhere and my budget depended on my ability to get some rental income from using Airbnb to rent a room or on weekends or whatever, then it would be useful for me to know that this particular area has the tendency to do poorly when unemployment in a particular region increases suddenly, or when the US economy is doing poorly, or when some international economy is doing poorly. It is a kind of roundabout way to figure out where the demand for Airbnbs for a particular region or city is coming from. Places with a lot of international tourism might have price sensitivity related to German or Chinese measures of consumer activity and unemployment. But places with a lot of regional tourism might be totally insensitive to that and only depend on how well the fracking industry is doing. So if I am trying to decide between cities and I want a good estimate of what I can get out of AirBnB over the course of a thirty year mortgage this dasboard can help.
